Welcome
=================
These tutorials provide an introduction to the QGIS software and support the lecture notes on Introduction to GIS. Although the tutorials are pitched at the level of an introductory college level GIS course, you don't need to know anything about QGIS to begin the tutorials as we take a beginner's-friendly approach to learning the software.

Topics covered by the different tutorials include thematic mapping, loading data from different sources, map projections, attribute and spatial queries, terrain mapping and analysis, geocoding, digitizing, geoprocessing, spatial interpolation, and spatial statistics.
