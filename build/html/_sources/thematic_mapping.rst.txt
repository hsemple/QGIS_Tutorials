Thematic Mapping
=======================
   
A popular way of presenting information about spatial patterns is to use a thematic map. A thematic map shows the spatial distribution of one or more specific data themes for selected geographic areas. The data may be quantitative (e.g., percentage population change, income distribution) or qualitative  (e.g., predominant farm types, mineral distribution in the USA, mountain systems in the Americas).

With a GIS software, the basic way to create a vector thematic map is to identify and scrutinize the field in the attribute table of the map layer that will be used for mapping. Next, display the data using the software's thematic mapping engine.  Some amouht of thought is required here. If the data is quantitative, select one of the quantitative thematic mapping style, e.g., graduated color, proportional symbols, dot density, etc.  We also have to think about the color scheme for the map, the number of classes or bins into which the data will be placed, how the data will be classified, e.g., natural break, equal area, etc, and whether the data should be normalized.  If the data is qualitative, we create a qualitative thematic map, which may also vary in appearance depending on the details of the data.

Assignment
------------

1. Create a thematic choropleth map showing population distribution by states in the USA.  The data for this exercise can be found at  this `Github link <https://github.com/hsemple/-Covid19/blob/master/USA-2.zip>`_.  Click on the *Download* button and download the USA states shapefile.  


2. Using the same data as above, create a proportional symbol map. 


3. Health care policy makers would like to understand the distribution of Covid19 cases across the United States. As as GIS analyst, create for them a thematic choropleth map showing Covid19 cases for Counties in the USA for February 2022.  Download a USA County Shapefile with Covid19 data February 2022 `here <https://github.com/hsemple/-Covid19/blob/master/usa_counties_covid_Feb25_2021.zip>`_.



Follow the instructions below to complete Numbers 1 and 2 above. Complete Number 3 on your own.

Creating a Choropleth Thematic Map
-------------------------------------

1. After downloading the data, unzip or extract it to a location that you can remember.


2. Load the map layer into QGIS.


3. Right click on the name of the layer and select Open Attribute table. Inspect the attribute table. We will use the column that contains population data for the US. Examine the population data, then close the attribute table.


4. Now, right click on the layer name again and choose ‘Properties’.

6. Click on the drop-down button at the top right of the Symbology dialog and you will see several options, e.g., Single Symbol, Categorized, Graduated, Rule Based, etc.

7. The graduated style is used when you want to map fields in which the data are numerical quantities.  The graduated scheme will create choropleth maps, i.e., maps in which varying colors are used to represent different sized quantities.  Categorized is used when the values in the columns refer to categories of information, e.g. Democrats = 1, Republicans = 2, Independents = 3. In this case, the numbers 1,2, and 3 are not quantities, but categories.
 



8. To map the population column, select Graduated as the Style.  Select Population as the column to map. Click on the dropdown next to Color Ramp and select also a color ramp. For numerical data that goes from lower values to higher values, one can select a single color ramp.  Lower values will be given a lighter version of the color while higher values will be given a darker version of the color.

9. Select the default 5 as the number of classes. Most cartographers suggest 5-6 classes as providing the best results.  Since we selected five classes, QGIS will place the population totals of the 50 states into 5 groups.  


10. Next to "Mode", select "Natural Breaks" as the method of classification or grouping the data. Natural breaks means that the software will rank the data from highest to lowest and then create five groups such that each group contains numbers that are generally similar to each other. The goal is to create groupings of similar numbers rather than groups of equal number of cases. You can also experiment with equal interval, standard deviation, etc. to see their effect. Click Classify.

   :alt: Mapping Attributes



11. You can also set the boundaries of the groups manually. Click on the Histogram tab then select Load Data.  You can now edit the class boundaries by moving the vertical lines with your mouse. You can also click on an empty space to add new class boundaries. 


.. image:: img/mapping_attributes5b.png
   :alt: Histogram


12. Next to Legend Format, the %1 - %2 lets you control how you want the lower and upper numbers to appear in the legend. %1 is the lower number and %2 is the upper number.  Precision controls the number of decimal places that will appear in the legend while the Trim option removes excess trailing zeroes.


13. Click OK and see the map in the main QGIS window. This map definitely conveys a lot more useful information that just numbers in a table.

**Preparing the Choropleth Map for Printing**

1. Now that you are familiar with the process of creating a thematic chropleth map, the final step is "compose" the map for printing.  This is phase where your artistic skill comes into play.  I strongly suggest that you look over the lecture notes on map design principles, as they provide important information on how to style your final map.  Key components of a professional map include:
   •  The map body
   •  The title of the map 
   •  The scale bar
   •  The north arrow  
   •  The legend 
   •  Data Source (optional)


2. QGIS comes with an application called "Composer" that is used to create professional quality layouts. 
 
 
3. With the map you are working on still opened in QGIS, click on Project on the main menu, then ‘New Print Layout'.  


.. image:: img/composing_map1.png
   :alt: Composing Map



3. Enter a name for the new print composer object that will be created, e.g., "Population Distribution USA". A new print Composer window will open.  You may have to use the Zoom button to adjust the size of the main map area of composer.

.. image:: img/composing_map2.png
   :alt: Composing Map


4. The Print Composer tool contains four main parts: (1) a menu at the top of the screen, (2) a toolbar to the left, (3) the main map area, which has blank canvas where you would be composing the map, and (4) a panel with three tabs to the right, Composition, Item Properties, and Guides.
 

5. To add a map to composer, click on Add Item on the main menu, then click "Add Map".b Now draw a rectangle container on the canvas to hold the map.  When you end the rectangle, the map will appear.  Note: If you do not like the rectangle size, you can always resize it afterwards.
 

.. image:: img/composing_map3.png
   :alt: Composing Map


 
6. If you wanted to enlarge the map and show only the contiguous states, then go back to the map area, and enlarge the view there. You may have to delete the rectangle and redraw it.


7. Click inside the box and drag the map container until it is centered on the page. 


8. To add a scalebar, click on Add Item on the main menu, then select "Add Scalebar".  Draw a rectangle on the composition where you want to place the scale bar then release. The scalebar will appear. Resize the scalebar to suit your taste.
 

9. With the scalebar selected, click on "Item Properties" to the right of the composer. Here you can fiddle with the different values to adjust elements of the scalebar's appearance.
 

10. Repeat the same process as described in 8 above to add north arrow and legend to your map. Title and other text are added with the "Add Label" button on the Toolbar to the left.  Here is  view of my completed map.
 

.. image:: img/composing_map4.png
   :alt: Composing Map

 
11. Once you are satisfied with the map, you can export it as Image, PDF or SVG. For this tutorial, let’s export it as a PNG image. Click onLayout | Export as Image.  Select a path and a name for the exported image.  This image can be uploaded to Canvas Dropbox.
 

12. Creating attractive maps requires knowledge about map design and map communication principles.  There is a large body of literature on elements of good map design. In Module 1.6,  I present some basic maps design ideas.  Please read these design ideas and try to integrate them as much as possible into your own map design. 
 

13. As a rule, always try to create beautiful maps that effectively communicate spatial information. Conversely, always try to avoid creating ugly maps that fail to effectively communicate useful information.


14. Submit this map as proof that you completed the tutorial.

Creating a Proportional Symbol Map
-------------------------------------

Creating proportional symbols maps in QGIS is relatively. The workflow entails obtaining a points layer of the dataset and then symbolizing the points layer. The points layer can be symbolized as proportional symbols or graduated proportional symbols.


1. In our situation, the data is available as a polygon layer, so we can convert the polygon layer into a points layer by clicking on Vector in the top menu, then selecting Geometry Tools | Centroids.

.. image:: img/thematic_maps_proportional_symbolmap1.png
   :alt: Points Map 


2. When the dialog appears, ensure that the polygon layer is selected as the input file then click Run.  This will create a points layer from the polygon layer. All attribute fields will be preserved.

.. image:: img/thematic_maps_proportional_symbolmap2.png
   :alt: Mapping Attributes


3. Right click on the *Centroid* layer that was created and select *Properties*.


4.  Click on *Symbology* then fill out the dialog.  Start by selecting *Single Symbol* to create a single symbol map. 

.. image:: img/thematic_maps_proportional_symbolmap3.png
   :alt: Single Symbol Map


5. Make sure that Simple Marker is highlighted then click on the dropdown to the right of the Size textbox. This will reveal the Assistant.

.. image:: img/thematic_maps_proportional_symbolmap4.png
   :alt: Select Simple Marker


6. When the Assistant dialog appears, click on the dropdown to the right of Source and select the field that you wish to map. In this case, select the *Pop_2015* field. 

.. image:: img/thematic_maps_proportional_symbolmap5.png
   :alt: Assistant Dialog


7. To the far right of the 'Values From' text box, click on the refresh button to load the minimum and maximum values for the selected values. In this case, there are several zeroes, so these are ignored and the next lowest value, 580000 was entered manually. I also adjusted the maximum symbol size to 20 to enhancee the appearance of fhe map. 


8. The resultant map should appear as shown below.

.. image:: img/thematic_maps_proportional_symbolmap6.png
   :alt: Default Proportional Symbol Map


9. By default, QGIS does not create a legend. To manually create a legend, double click on the name of the proportional symbol layer to bring up the properties dialog. 


10. Click on Marker, then click on Advanced | Data-Defined Size Legend.

.. image:: img/thematic_maps_proportional_symbolmap7.png
   :alt: Data-Defined Size Legend


11. In the dialog that appears, select Collapsed legend then click Ok.

.. image:: img/thematic_maps_proportional_symbolmap8.png
   :alt: Collapsed legend


12. In the Table of Content, expand the legend of the Centroid layer.  It should appear as shown below.

.. image:: img/thematic_maps_proportional_symbolmap9.png
   :alt: New Legend


13. Now go to Composer and set up the map for printing. In Composer, the final map should appear similar to the illustration shown below.
