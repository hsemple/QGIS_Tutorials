Overview
=================

The tutorials on this website provide an introduction to the QGIS software.  They assume that you are actively learning GIS concepts elsewhere and are seeking to test and experiment with those concepts using the QGIS software.   

Each tutorial is built around one or more exercises in which a GIS problem is tackled. Step by step procedures are provided on how to complete the exercise. Deliverables are based on the step by step procedures and/ or problems similar to the ones solved by the step procedures.

Topics covered by the different tutorials include thematic mapping, loading data from different sources, map projections, attribute and spatial queries, terrain mapping and analysis, geocoding, digitizing, geoprocessing, spatial interpolation, spatial statistics, and web mapping. There is also a section on how to run Python scripts to automate processes.


For more detailed instructions on how to use all aspects of QGIS, see the documentation - https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/index.html
