Welcome
=================
One of the best ways to learn GIS is to study GIS concepts and then practice extensively with the software. The tutorials on this website provide an introduction to the QGIS software.  They assume that you are actively learning GIS concepts separately and are seeking to test and experiment with those concepts using the QGIS software.   


Topics covered by the different tutorials include thematic mapping, loading data from different sources, map projections, attribute and spatial queries, terrain mapping and analysis, geocoding, digitizing, geoprocessing, spatial interpolation, spatial statistics, web mapping, and drone mapping. There is also a section on how to run Python scripts to automate processes.


For more detailed instructions on how to use all aspects of QGIS, see the documentation - https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/index.html
